# fetch-media-metadata
This little pet project of mine fetches metadata of your music from the internet using the Gracenote API. Later I plan on expanding this to download metadata about tv shows and automatically rename them according to season and the episode name. eg. foldername is Arrow\Season 1\S01E01-Pilot
